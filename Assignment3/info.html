    Fourth Wing
</h2>
<p>
       This trilogy starts with Fourth Wing, and continues on with Iron Flame and Onxy Storm. I devowerd
    Fourth Wing, it throws you into this world where dragons have attituded like teenagers. Battle scenes,
    that will have you wanting more, and an ending that made me scream WHAT! And then I went out and 
    immediately bought the second book because I had to know what was next.

<h2>
    Iron Flame 
</h2>
<p>

       The second book just made me love the characters even more, and made me dislike the villans even
    more as well. There is love and loss in both books that will forever stick with me. Rebecca Yarros has 
    written these characters so well. I wish they were actual people so I could become friends with them.
    There is commic relief thank god, because I don't know if I could get through this book with out it.

<h2>
    Onxy Storm
</h2>
<p>
    
    As far as the third book Onxy Storm I am currently reading it, and I am not sure I want it to end.
This trilogy has been so good, and I wish I could read it again for the first time. 
I got my fiance to read the first,and second book. He is currently waiting for me to finish the third book so he can read it. I also got my best friend to 
read it as well.
