#Fourth Wing

##Rebecca Yarros

#### Fourth Wing is about Violet who is percieved as weak, but is thrown into a world that could easily kill her. She makes friends, encounters enemies, and meets two interesting trustworthy companions. Through out her journey she finds out some interesting news, goes to war, and has some wins and some losses. Overall Fourth Wing is a really good read. The world building is great, the story keeps you on your toes, and the characters are really well done. I highly recommend giving it a read.
