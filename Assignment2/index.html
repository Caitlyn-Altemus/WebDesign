<p>Twenty year old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. 
  Now, the commanding general also known as her tough as talons mother. 
  Has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre dragon riders.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p> A dragon without its rider is a tragedy. A rider without their dragon is dead. 
  That is part of the riders codex and is true more ways than one. Riders share a unique bond
  with their dragons. They can talk with them through their minds, and tap into the dragons power.
</p>


<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p> A rider does not choose their dragon, the dragon choose them. And if a rider doesn't get choosen
  they have to wait a whole year to try again. The ceremony is called threshing and it can get pretty ugly.
  people die, people get revenge and some get lucky and live. 
</p>


<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<P> Violet goes through hell basically the whole book, but she never backs down. Even when 
  she has a giant red target on her back. And people are constantly plotting to murder her in her sleep.
  Luckily she makes some good friends who always have her back. And eventually gets a bodygaurd who becomes a good friend.
