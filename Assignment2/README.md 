I would say the challenges this week were adding images. I had help from my fiance, and the teacher.
 And also going over the lessons multiple times to double check every thing. I would say I am proud of
 how the site is turning out, it may be nothing fancy but it works and to me that right now is all that
 matters. I feel like I am doing okay with every thing. As far as support goes, for me just keep responding to emails
 that really helps me out.
